HT21 Data visualization with R 


## Final project

I chose 16 languages of Africa to investigate two research questions:

- How diverse is the color terms?
- How different is the basic color terms (RGB) among languages? - Does the distance of region matter?

Codes and reports are under the folder _final_ .
